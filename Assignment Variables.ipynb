    "Ex.: `message_1` but not `1_message`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spaces are not allowed in variables names,but underscores can be used to seperate wordsin variables names.\n",
    "Ex.:`greeting_message` works,but `greeting message` will cause errors.\n",
    "3. Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variables names;that is do not Python has reserved that Python has reserved for particular programmic purpose,such as the word `print`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variables names should be short but descriptive.\n",
    "Ex.:*name* is better than *n*, *student_name* is better than *s_n*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Be careful when using the lowercase letter *'l'* and then the uppercase letter *'O'* because they could be confused with the numbers *'1'* & *'0'*."
